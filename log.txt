18/07: 	Isi helped me find a new topic and dataset: Satellite Image Classification https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification

19/07: 	Started with new project from scratch. Learned how to conduct directory operations with os and shutil
	Data explored and cleaned
	Duplicated images are copied images with a name format that would pass as unique at first glance but fixed it
	There was no dataframe to accompany image data, so I worked with nested lists that I created
	Then realised how stupid that was and decided to use dataframe instead

20/07: 	Created dataframe with image names and classes
	Adapted notebook
	Balanced Data

21/07: 	Train-test split and dataframe fitted to it
	Began research on CNNs

22/07: 	Fixed lack of data for baseline models, wrote function for train-test split
	Decided that I will probably not work on computer vision, CNN and XGBoost enough for the project
	CNN research continues:

	FOUND ERROR in my handling of directories. Test set needs to be mixed. Validation set needed. Replace test set with validation set and create test from remaining train set
		MUST ADD DESTINATION PATHS FOR TEST SETS. MUST ADD DESTINATION FOR TEST SET TO homemade_split. MUST ADAPT WHOLE SCRIPT. MUST RUN IT ONCE WITH ADAPTATIONS TO SEE EVERYTHING WORKS
	Fixed most of the script, homemade_split seems finished, MUST SET UP VARIABLES AND RUN

23/07:	Running, making last adjustments to patched up script. All seems fine.
	Trying to decide on a reasonable train-test split.

	FOUND ERROR: Split should be conducted with random.seed(number) and sample(filenames, how_much) instead of sample() alone, because I want the data to shuffle, but in a deterministic way
	Potential sensible comparisons: 1. Baseline model with imbalanced_df vs. model with balanced_df with same parameter tuning
					2. Model with balanced_df vs. same model with balanced_df and different parameter tuning
					3. Balanced_df with different models and best possible scores of each model
	Had to fix homemade_split yet again, kept stumbling into errors. Took the entire evening and still nothing to show for it...
	Problem lied in a ":" symbol I could not see to delete. Finally managed to fix it. Script adapted. Sets prepared. Ready for a test drive

To Do: 	RESEARCH MORE
	BASELINE MODELs BEFORE BALANCED SET MODELs
	KERAS
	XGBOOST
