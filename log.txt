18/07: Isi helped me find a new topic and dataset: Satellite Image Classification https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification
19/07: Started with new project from scratch. Learned how to conduct directory operations with os and shutil
	Data explored and cleaned
	Duplicated images are copied images with a name format that would pass as unique at first glance but fixed it
	There was no dataframe to accompany image data, so I worked with nested lists that I created
	Then realised how stupid that was and decided to use dataframe instead
20/07: Created dataframe with image names and classes
	Adapted notebook
	Balanced Data
21/07: Train-test split and dataframe fitted to it
	Began research on CNNs
To Do: RESEARCH MORE
	KERAS
	XGBOOST
	COMPUTER VISION
	BASELINE MODEL BEFORE BALANCED SET MODEL
	FUNCTION TO MOVE ELEMENTS SOONER IN NOTEBOOK
