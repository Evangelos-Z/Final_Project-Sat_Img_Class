# Satellite Image Classification (multi-class)

## Problem Description
Classification of satellite photography into 4 classes: "cloudy", "desert", "green area" or "water".

## Dataset
The original data used can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification. It contains a total of 5631 images, separated in 4 folders, representing each of the 4 classes respectively.

## Approach
The dataset was mapped and a dataframe containing the image names and their class was created as frame of reference. After data exploration and processing, a deep learning model (keras CNN) was compiled and trained on them.


The project was carried out as the final assignment of my Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin.
