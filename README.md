# Satellite Image Classification with Keras (multi-class)

The present project was conducted as the final assignment for a remote Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack and was carried out in 10 days.
<br>
<br>The process followed has been saved in 2 Notebooks,  the first one [TITLES TITLES] pertaining to the data cleaning and the second one [TITLES TITLES] containing data augmentation, model training, evaluation and a short demo.

## Problem Description
Classification of satellite photography into 4 classes ("cloudy", "desert", "green area" or "water"), depending on the area depicted.

## Dataset
The dataset contains a total of 5631 images, separated in 4 folders, each representing one of the 4 classes. The original data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification).

## Approach
The data was mapped, explored, processed and augmented with the purpose of training a Deep Learning Model, namely Keras, which is an API, written in Python and utilising Tensorflow's machine learning platform. Data augmentation was achieved via Keras's ImageDataGenerator class.

The model's architecture was provided through the courtesy of [Isi](https://github.com/isi-mube).

Parameter tuning was conducted manually and was based on paradigms, articles and documentation.

## The Juice
The model performed fairly well both when dealing with imbalanced as well as with balanced data (95% and 98% accuracy respectively), but it was more stable throughout the process when dealing with the balanced set.

## Hurdles
Unfortunately, the time dedicated to the project had to be cut short. What was supposed to be a 3-week project ended up being wrapped up in 10 days as the

The time constrain along with the suboptimal resource management by Tesnsorflow on Windows 10 Native, which does not offer any easy solutions for GPU utilisation made it hard to get into a more extensive exploration of different configurations for the model.

## Special Thanks and Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible if not for:

Xisca, whose guidance, hands-on knowledge and words of encouragement helped me push through.

Laz, who has been my anchor to reality, supported me and has helped me debug my brain when I needed it most.

[Sabina](https://github.com/sabinagio), who has been an inspiration from day 1 

and lastly, but far, far from least [Isi](https://github.com/isi-mube), who seems to believe in me more than I do myself.<br>
                                    [...]It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends. But you and I will always be back then.
